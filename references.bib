 abstract = {This paper presents the principles of robustness design of axle system dynamics to reduce vehicle system related axle gear whine. Through examining the physics of the axle gear noise, the influence of the system dynamics are identified as two parts, i.e., the dynamics mesh force generated at the gear meshing per unit gear mesh motion variation; and the force transmissibility from mesh to the axle housing, and then further to the bracket attachments. The noise sensitive design parameters are identified and discussed. Component design requirements are proposed to minimize the system resonances in the typical gear mesh frequency range. The use of FEA models for system understanding and further design tuning is illustrated.},

In this paper, the authors describe a new method of application of modal analysis and building block technology which has been made possible by advances in minicomputer software. Examples of recent projects performed by SDRC* are described, which illustrate how a test engineer can identify and evaluate various fixes to a vehicle vibration problem utilizing a minicomputer based hardware-software system in his laboratory.

abstract = {Identification of modal parameters is crucial especially in aerospace applications whereby the interactions of airflow with aircraft structures can result in undesirable structural deformations. This structural deformation can be predicted with knowledge of the modal parameters. This can be achieved through conventional modal testing that requires a known excitation force in order to extract these dynamic properties. This technique can be experimentally complex because of the need for artificial excitation and it also does not represent actual operational condition. The current work presents part of research work that address the practical implementation of operational modal analysis (OMA) applied to a cantilevered hybrid composite plate exposed to low speed airflow in a wind tunnel. A single contactless sensing system via a laser vibrometer is employed to measure the response. OMA technique applied in a wind-on condition succeeded in extracting the modal parameters of the hybrid composite plate which correlate well with modal testing using impact hammer excitation.}

abstract = {Research developments for structural dynamics in the fields of design, system identification and structural health monitoring (SHM) have dramatically expanded the bounds of what can be learned from measured vibration data. However, significant challenges remain in the tasks of identification, prediction and evaluation of full-scale structures. A significant aid in the roadmap to the application of cutting-edge methods to the demands of in-service engineering structures, is the development of comprehensive benchmark datasets. With the aim of developing a useful and worthwhile benchmark dataset for structural dynamics, an extensive testing campaign is presented here. This recent campaign was performed on a decommissioned BAE system Hawk T1A aircraft at the Laboratory for Verification and Validation (LVV) in Sheffield. The aim of this paper is to present the dataset, providing details on the structure, experimental design, and data acquired. The collected data is made freely and openly available with the intention that it serve as a benchmark dataset for challenges in full-scale structural dynamics. Here, the details pertaining to two test phases (frequency and time domain) are presented. So as to ensure that the presented dataset is able to function as a benchmark, some baseline-level results are additionally presented for the tasks of identification and prediction, using standard approaches. It is envisaged that advanced methodologies will demonstrate superiority by favourable comparison with the results presented here. Finally, some dataset-specific challenges are described, with a view to form a hierarchy of tasks and frame discussion over their relative difficulty.}

abstract = {In Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), measured data that correspond to an extensive set of operational and damage conditions (for a given structure) are rarely available. One potential solution considers that information might be transferred, in some sense, between similar systems. A population-based approach to SHM looks to both model and transfer this missing information, by considering data collected from groups of similar structures. Specifically, in this work, a framework is proposed to model a population of nominally-identical systems, such that (complete) datasets are only available from a subset of members. The SHM strategy defines a general model, referred to as the population form, which is used to monitor a homogeneous group of systems. First, the framework is demonstrated through applications to a simulated population, with one experimental (test-rig) member; the form is then adapted and applied to signals recorded from an operational wind farm.}

abstract = {Bridges are valuable infrastructure assets that are challenging and expensive to maintain. State-of-the-art data-based bridge SHM solutions look to use bridge response data for condition assessment and damage detection. Data-based SHM methods can be limited in their application as they require large datasets to train models effectively, and most bridges lack the available data for the approaches to work. Further, it would be expensive and unrealistic to collect the required datasets to employ data-based methods to entire bridge networks. Recently, a population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM) approach was proposed that seeks to leverage the data available for SHM problems by pooling together similar structures with their datasets. The PBSHM approach could be valuable in bridge SHM, enhancing the datasets available for ‘populations of bridges. The PBSHM approach for assessing the similarity of bridges has been considered before and was shown to be useful for identifying similar and different bridge types. However, no data were considered in the previous work, and similarity metrics were only qualified using engineering judgement. For the PBSHM approach to be useful in bridge SHM, there is still a need to check that ‘similar’ bridges have similar responses for transfer learning to be feasible. This paper expands upon previous work and provides originality by investigating if bridges identified as similar also exhibit similar responses. The PBSHM derived similarity metrics convey the topological similarity between structures, and mode shapes are identified as being a topologically sensitive bridge response. Therefore, a modal test campaign is carried out for a set of six real bridges, and Operational Modal Analysis is used to identify modal responses from each of the bridge decks. The Modal Assurance Criterion is used to evaluate the similarity between the mode shapes from pairs of bridges and is subsequently compared to the similarity metrics evaluated between those bridges. The similarity metrics were found to be reflective of the similarities identified between the respective bridges’ mode shapes for bridges of the same and different types. The significance of this finding is that it is an important step towards validating the PBSHM comparison approach for identify similar structures where transfer learning might be attempted.}

abstract = {An accurate description of machine tool dynamics is essential for health monitoring, chatter prevention, and improvement of manufacturing accuracy. The standard identification approach of experimental modal analysis at the standstill of the machine does not realize the possible variations in the dynamics due to operational conditions. The in-process identification methods in the literature, on the other hand, are associated with implementation difficulties in industrial environments due to the required complex and specially-designed setup, limited excitation forms, or excessive measurement efforts. This paper proposes an industrial-friendly method to estimate the in-process structural dynamics of machine tools, considering practical demands and implementation limits. Knowing that the operational dependency of the dynamics is associated with the machine and spindle structure, the machine–spindle and holder–tool structures are considered two distinguished subsystems. The cross Frequency Response Function (FRF) of the coupled structure, between the tooltip and spindle flange, is determined by measuring forced vibrations during milling operations. The milling forces are considered as excitation input and the process is designed to be stable and chatter-free so that the simulated forces can be accurately used in the identification. Then, the receptance coupling theory is utilized to develop an optimization algorithm. Given the model of the coupled structure, the evolutionary optimization tunes the modal parameters of the machine–spindle dynamics and joint parameters until the predicted cross FRFs match the experimentally determined FRFs. The direct FRF at the tooltip is predicted using identified in-process machine–spindle dynamics through the receptance coupling method. The identified in-process dynamics are used to predict stability diagrams for different tooling systems and, moreover, to design an augmented Kalman filter to estimate cutting forces. Comparison of estimated SLDs and cutting forces with chatter test results and dynamometer measurements validate the outcomes of the proposed identification method. This paper demonstrates that the system dynamics under operational conditions can be successfully identified without requiring costly setup, specially-designed workpieces or operations, and destructive chatter tests.}

TITLE = {Can We Rely on Open-Source Energy System Optimization Models? The TEMOA-Italy Case Study},

ABSTRACT = {Energy system models have become crucial to assess the effectiveness of possible energy policies in pursuing the declared environmental objectives. Among bottom-up models, the tools most widely used by researchers and institutions to perform scenario analyses and policy evaluations rely on commercial software and closed databases, limiting the transparency of the studies. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that open-source tools, relying on open databases, can be used as a valid alternative to commercial tools, getting equivalent results not only for simple case studies as done so far, but also for complex (national, regional, or multi-regional) reference energy systems. Working on the already available open TEMOA optimization framework, a bottom-up technology-rich model is developed here for the Italian reference energy system on an extended TEMOA version, comparable in detail and complexity to the equivalent TIMES framework. The accuracy of the novel TEMOA-Italy model in a business-as-usual scenario is assessed, showing that the average relative differences with respect to the consolidated TIMES-Italy results are in the order of few percent. The open-source model, available on Github, is now ready for the test and implementation of new optimization paradigms, which was not possible in the TIMES framework.},
